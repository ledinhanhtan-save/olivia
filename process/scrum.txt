(Scrum Framework)
	scrum -> agile

	embraces changes
	reduces risks and costs
	is a regular and tangible process

(Sprint)
	A short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work
	Sprints make projects more manageable, allow teams to ship high-quality work faster and more frequently,
	and gives them more flexibility to adapt to change

	Sprint cycle:
		product backlog -> sprint backlog -> increment/demo
			1. sprint planning -> daily scrum -> sprint review -> sprint retro

	1. product owner -> product backlog -> sprint goal
	2. daily scrum -> about how the work is progressing -> sprint goal
	3. sprint review -> demo, showcase -> stakeholders
	4. sprint retro -> indentify areas of improvement

	(Do)
		understand: sprint goal + how success will be mesure
		well-groomed backlog: priorities + dependencies
		encourage: team member to sketch out tasks
		leave out: dependencies: another team / designs / legal sign-off
		capture: information -> jira tickets
	(Don't)
		don't pull too many stories / overestimate velocity / impossible tasks
		don't forget about quality and technical debt
		don't force it to be fast, make the vision clear
		don't take large amount of unknown or high-risk work -> next sprint
		don't ignore the team's concerns -> address the issue and recalibrate

	(Optimize with automation)
